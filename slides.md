## Grades
* Exam <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Note: 
The Exam will take place on 8th of February and I hope you will find enough hints in the next two days on how to prepare for it. Unfortunately I took over the seminar from another lecturer just a month ago. So there are no older tests with which you can prepare.

# Classic Project Management
Note:
Ask students what a Project is.
Definition: Undertaking that is distinguished by its uniqueness:
* novelty
* exceptionality
* complexity
* interdisciplinary


??VERTICAL
## The Magic Triangle
Note:
Project Success only by fulfilling the Magic Triangle
* Create panel with students 
  * Scope
  * Time
  * Cost

??VERTICAL
## Specification Booklet
* initial situation
* desired situation
* role definitions
* functional specifications
* non-functional specifications


??VERTICAL
## Bid
Note:
According to the specification booklet and the applicable law, the ProjectManager will provide a bid to the customer. In german PM you differentiate between the so called "Lastenheft" and the "Pflichtenheft". The first one contains mainly what the customer wants, where as the second one contains the plan, how you, the project holder, will fulfill that will. 

The documentation of this is seen as very important to solve legal questions, that might arise if the project finishes too late or the customer will not be satisfied by the project result.

??VERTICAL
## SMART Goals
* Specific <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Measurable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Attractive <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Reasonable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Time-bound <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
* Specific means it should be clear what should be reached.
* Measurable means it should be possible to find out if the goals has been reached
* Attractive means it should be a goal that is obviously an improvement
* Reasonable means it should be realistic to reach that goal
* Time-bound means it should be reachable in a reasonable amount of time

## Stakeholder Analysis
* Stakeholder listing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Stakeholder affection <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Stakeholder classification <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Stakeholder strategies <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Note:
Stakeholder are all persons or communities that are affected by the project. Of course there is the customer, who invests in the money.
But there might be also his employees who might not support the project idea. There are also third parties who might be affected, like
local residents nearby a building project.

For each of those persons or groups we have to find out their expectations about the project and by that we need to estimate their affection by the project and whether they would be affected positively or negatively.

??VERTICAL
## Risk Analysis
* Probability
* Impact
  * Cost in Money
  * High / Middle / Low
* Mitigation Strategy
Note:
Risks are issues that may endanger the Project goal. We have to estimate the probability that a risk realizes and the impact it may come with. By that you might find risks that would be far out of the realm of your project although the endanger your project. But for example, when you are responsible for a software project you are endangered by a fire in the server room. But effectively you can not handle it. Your Budget would not suffice to prevent that risk. So you can inform your boss, but you can not handle that risk for your self.

## Exercise Stakeholder Analysis / Risk Analysis

## Work Breakdown Structure
* Object-oriented Structure <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Function-oriented Structure <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Combinations of both  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* prepared Structures <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
WBS should break up the complexity of the project into smaller, better predictable tasks. There are several possibilities to break up the project. This step is essential for the further steps.

??VERTICAL
## Perecedence Diagram Method
* Tasks as Nodes
* Tasklist with predecessors and successors
* Gantt-Diagram
* Calculating Buffers
* Critical Path
Note:
Tasks from the WSB have to be estimated by their duration and by their dependency on each other. Based on that information we can create a Tasklist with predecessors and successors. This will allow us to create a so called Gantt-Diagramm (named after Henry L. Gantt).
By that we can already see how long the project will take. When we apply the Precedence Diagram Method to it, we can see, which tasks have buffers we can use to compensate possible delays. And the nodes without buffers form the critical path, which, if any node in it delays is a delay for the whole project.

## Exercise WSB/PDM

## Milestone Trend Analysis
* The concept of Milestones
* What we can see by the MTA
* How to draw a MTA

# Agile

Note:
Yesterday we examined classical Project Management. We talked about "Lastenheft" and "Pflichtenheft" and "Precedence Diagram Method". All these try to make the course of the project stable and predictable. And the mindset of it is, you need measure your own interests over those of your customer. If she or he might not be satisfied by the project result, it would be your task as project manager to find the fitting rhetoric to retune your customer. Maybe you will be successfull in this single case, but it is highly questionable if your customer will repeat business. Therefore you can see a new trend that came from IT-Industry and is taking over more and more companies.

The point is, the project work is very important. But you have to admit, that without your Team you can do nothing. And if you are not able to find a connection to your customer and to your team, the project result has always the risk of not fulfilling the required quality. and without quality your customer will never be satisfied.

## The two souls of the ProjectManager
<img src="images/jekyll&hide.png">
Note:
The classical Project Manager therefor has conflicting interests. She or he wants to fulfill the requirements of the customers which means to hold the time-bound. On the other hand the team might come to the conclusion, that it is not possible to hold the bound or only under overtime. So whose side should the PM protect?

Note:
Based on the Scrum Lego Game we will set up a Backlog fullfilling the needs of the fictive customer Dr Evil, who wants to setup his secret headquater from where he want's to reach for world domination.

??VERTICAL
## Scrum Docs
* Definition of Ready
* Definition of Done
* The Scrum board

## Relationship to the Customer
Note: Can you see how the relation ship to the customer changes. You are now no longer talking the customer into something he does not want. You have a trustful relation ship, where each side understands the other.
