The Exam will take place on 8th of February and I hope you will find enough hints in the next two days on how to prepare for it. Unfortunately I took over the seminar from another lecturer just a month ago. So there are no older tests with which you can prepare.

In the research project, you will be asked to plan a project. On saturday, I will give you five topics from which you pick one as a group of three or four. Each of you in the group will get the same grade for the research project.

Your final grade will depend for 2/3s on the Exam an 1/3 on the reserch project, which you will have to provide until ...

## Bid
Note:
According to the specification booklet and the applicable law, the ProjectManager will provide a bid to the customer. In german PM you differentiate between the so called "Lastenheft" and the "Pflichtenheft". The first one contains mainly what the customer wants, where as the second one contains the plan, how you, the project holder, will fulfill that will. 

The documentation of this is seen as very important to solve legal questions, that might arise if the project finishes too late or the customer will not be satisfied by the project result.

## Work Breakdown Structure

# Agile

Note:
Yesterday we examined classical Project Management. We talked about "Lastenheft" and "Pflichtenheft" and "Precedence Diagram Method". All these try to make the course of the project stable and predictable. And the mindset of it is, you need measure your own interests over those of your customer. If she or he might not be satisfied by the project result, it would be your task as project manager to find the fitting rhetoric to retune your customer. Maybe you will be successfull in this single case, but it is highly questionable if your customer will repeat business. Therefore you can see a new trend that came from IT-Industry and is taking over more and more companies.

The point is, the project work is very important. But you have to admit, that without your Team you can do nothing. And if you are not able to find a connection to your customer and to your team, the project result has always the risk of not fulfilling the required quality. and without quality your customer will never be satisfied.

## The two souls of the ProjectManager

Note:
The classical Project Manager therefor has conflicting interests. She or he wants to fulfill the requirements of the customers which means to hold the time-bound. On the other hand the team might come to the conclusion, that it is not possible to hold the bound or only under overtime.
